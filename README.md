# About

3D Physics Simulator runs on your browser and was written with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# Features

Easy to understand user interface, through which the user can add objects to the 3D space and assign attributes to them.<br>
Premade and custom **themes**.<br>

Currently supported shapes: cuboid, sphere and cylinder.<br>
Configurable physical attributes: dimensions, mass, position, velocity, rotation, angular velocity and force.<br>
Other configurable attributes: color, name and rendering type (opaque or frame only).<br>

**Tutorial** using notification style popups.<br>
Premade **examples** to demostrate capabilites of app.<br>
**Custom actions** based on time or object physical attributes (e.g. When time is 15s pause simulation and write to log).<br>
**Log** in which object attributes can be printed on command or using actions. A log entry (or the entire log) can be downloaded as a .txt file or a .json object.<br>
Saved log timestamps (from .json file) can be loaded into the simulation, in order to resume where you left off!.<br>

# Future Plans

- More shapes!
- Add ability to write PI and simple mathematical operations in rotation
- Grid and Grid Snapping
- Damping
- Reset settings to default button
- Selecting which objects are added to the log
